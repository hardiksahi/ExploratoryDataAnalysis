# ExploratoryDataAnalysis
Performed detailed data analysis on the following dataset:

# UCDP Georeferenced Event Dataset (GED) Global version 17.2 (2016)
  Features of the dataset:
a. Rows: 135183, Columns: 42.
b. Provides information regarding individual events of organized violence (phenomena of lethal violence occurring at a given time and place)
c. Events are sufficiently fine-grained to be geo-coded down to the level of individual villages, with temporal durations disaggregated to single, individudal days. 

The dataset has **geospatial and temporal information** associated with them.

# Purpose of Analysis of the dataset.
The purpose of the analysis was to analyze the patterns of armed conflicts that have been going on in the world in the past years. The information was fine-grained to the level of cities in the countries that were affected. Hence I found out multiple geospatial patterns in the data. This in turn has helped me to:

1. Identify the conflict zones around the world.
2. Which countries has maximum number of terrorist organizations active?
3. Which countries have had the most attacks on civilians (either by Government or Non Government entity)?
4. Which terrorist organizations are the most active throughout the world?
5. How has the global scenario evolved in terms of activities of government and non government activities in armed conflicts?
6. Has there been an increase or decrease of instances armed conflicts throughout the world?
7. Where have some of the most deadly attacks been?
8. Is the duration of conflict related to the number of deaths associated with the conflict?

These are only some of the many interesting questions that have been answered by the analysis of the first dataset.
